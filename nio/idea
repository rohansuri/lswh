Show a time server/date server/echo example, which sleeps for a while and replies
(sleep demonstrating the i/o)

And show scaling the web server by using simple java i/o (a thread per socket, or maybe using the thread pool and queued up i/o)

NIO Channels and Selectors based (request handling in a thread pool for those that are ready)

Finally NIO 2 based on Completion Handlers

Show stats that prove the scale.


Pick examples from Book "Pro Java NIO 2"
