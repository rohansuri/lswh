generate load:

for i in $(seq 1 100); do nc localhost 9999 & done

for i in $(seq 1 100); do kill %$i; done

lesson:
even though none of those 100 connections are "active" -- meaning no interaction is being done there,
we still put 100 threads from our pool to use and stay blocked

what'd be efficient is to attempt to read only when we know something surely is there!

answer: select(), poll(), epoll()
